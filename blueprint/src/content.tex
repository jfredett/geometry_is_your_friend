\begin{theorem}[Distinct nonparallel lines have a common point of intersection]
    \label{thm:ch2_p1_direct}
    \lean{Geometry.Ch2.Prop.P1.direct}
    \leanok
    Chapter 2, Proposition 2.1 (Directly as stated)

    pp. 71: If $L$ and $M$ are distinct lines that are not parallel, then $L$ and $M$ have a unique point in common
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[Distinct nonparallel lines intersect]
    \label{thm:ch2_p1}
    \lean{Geometry.Ch2.Prop.P1}
    \uses{thm:ch2_p1_direct}
    \leanok
    Chapter 2, Proposition 2.1

    A corrolary of the main theorem that is more useful since it uses the ``\_ intersects \_ at \_'' syntax directly.
\end{corollary}
