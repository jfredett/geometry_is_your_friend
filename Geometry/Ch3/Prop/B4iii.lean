"Corollary. (iii) If A and B are on opposite sides of L and if B and C are on the
same side of L, then A and C are on opposite sides of L"

Ed. This gets shown here since it's a corollary and I need a lemma from the
previous proposition

theorem B4iii :
  (L avoids A) ∧ (L avoids B) ∧ (L avoids C) ->
  (L splits A and B) ∧ (L guards B and C) -> (L splits A and C) := by

As is often the case, the above theorem once looked like a 5 page epic, but was
rapidly reduced when I found the correct way to think about it.

When I was a kid, I was homeschooled, and I was frustrated by that because I never
had much chance to make what I usually thought of as 'academic friends.' The sort of
people who were interested in the same kinds of weird niche things I was -- linguistics,
mathematics, philosophy, art, music.

My Dad liked those things too, well, he preferred programming to pure math, and religion
subsumed and subsumes his philosophy, art, and music; but he was close enough. Trouble was
he wasn't around much, so -- being a bright homeschooled kid with nothing better to do, I
hatched a little plan.
