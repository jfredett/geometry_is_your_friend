# geometry-is-your-friend

When I was a kid, I had a deeply formative experience learning geometry. When I
got to college, in my middle year, I took a course on geometry that used the
third edition of _Euclidean and Noneuclidean Geometry_, by Martin Greenberg.

I really love Geometry, even though it's caused me a fair amount of pain and
torment, and so I have returned here to formalize my favorite geometry book (so
far).

I don't really know Lean very well, but this seems like a good way to learn it.
I'll try to keep things organized enough that it's easy to find formal proofs of
the propositions and theora set out by Greenberg.

I do quote the book frequently, but I believe this work is transformative and
valuable, and thus Fair Use. That said, if the estate of Dr. Greenberg ever
happens by this and wants it taken down, I am happy to comply. I love his book,
I know it's a little strange to love a math text, but I love this one.
